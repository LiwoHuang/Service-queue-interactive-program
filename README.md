# Service-queue-interactive-program
# About
Implemented a Service Queue ADT in C with a hidden implementation of the list_struct using a doubly linked list to keep track of nodes. The service queue is an "incompletely specified type" with the definition of struct service_queue hidden in an implementation .c file. The implementation includes functions for creating an empty service queue, freeing a service queue, adding elements to the queue (push), retrieving and removing the first element from the queue (pop), getting the length of the queue, and checking if the queue is empty. Additionally, the implementation includes a buzzer bucket for re-using buzzer IDs and an on_queue array to keep track of buzzer IDs currently in the queue. The runtime requirements of the functions are specified in the comments of the code.
